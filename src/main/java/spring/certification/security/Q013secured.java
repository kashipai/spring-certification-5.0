/**
 * Spring v5.0 Professional Certification.
 * <p>
 * Question 013:<br>
 * What does Springâ€™s @Secured do?<br>
 * <p>
 * Answer:<br>
 * {@link Secured} annotation is used to define a list of authority restrictions (role permissions)
 * at least one of which should have been granted to a principal invoking the request.<br>
 * To enable processing of {@link Secured} annotations - {@link EnableGlobalMethodSecurity#securedEnabled()} attribute
 * should be set to {@code true}.
 * <p>
 * {@link RolesAllowed} is a similar annotation defined by JSR-250 specification.<br>
